## Known Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **Memory Bank Sync**: Manual synchronization required between KiloCode and Cline memory banks
2. **Template Validation**: Some edge cases in template validation need refinement
3. **Documentation Coverage**: Some advanced features lack comprehensive documentation

### Technical Debt

1. **Test Coverage**: Need more comprehensive unit tests for setup system
2. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages for template generation failures
3. **Performance**: Template processing could be optimized for very large projects

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Initial**: Single memory bank system approach
- **Evolution**: Dual memory bank strategy to support multiple AI tools
- **Current**: Parallel systems with manual synchronization
- **Future**: Automated synchronization between memory bank systems

### Technology Choices

- **Initial**: npm for package management
- **Evolution**: Switched to PNPM for better performance and workspace support
- **Current**: PNPM 8+ with optimized configuration
- **Future**: Continue with PNPM, explore additional optimizations

### Quality Strategy

- **Initial**: Basic linting and formatting
- **Evolution**: Comprehensive pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines
- **Current**: Multi-layered quality gates with security scanning
- **Future**: Enhanced metrics and automated quality reporting
