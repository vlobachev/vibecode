# Active Context - Vibecode Blueprint

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Task**: Setting up Cline/Roo Code Memory Bank system for the Vibecode Blueprint project. This involves creating the complete Cline Memory Bank structure with all core files to enable better AI understanding and context preservation across Cline sessions.

**Active Implementation**: Creating Cline-specific memory bank files following the official Cline documentation structure, which differs from the KiloCode Memory Bank system already implemented.

## Recent Changes

### Completed Today (2025-09-25)

- âœ… Created complete KiloCode AI Memory Bank system in `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/`
- âœ… Added `memory-bank-instructions.md` with full KiloCode AI documentation
- âœ… Created all KiloCode core files: brief.md, product.md, context.md, architecture.md, tech.md, tasks.md
- âœ… Successfully committed and pushed KiloCode Memory Bank changes
- âœ… Verified all GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines passed
- âœ… Created `.clinerules` file with Cline Memory Bank instructions
- âœ… Created `memory-bank/` directory for Cline system
- ðŸ”„ Currently creating Cline Memory Bank core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md)

### In Progress

- Creating remaining Cline Memory Bank files: activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md
- Adding Cline documentation to project knowledge base
- Creating Windsurf rules for Cline Memory Bank compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Cline Memory Bank core files:
   - systemPatterns.md (system architecture and design patterns)
   - techContext.md (technologies and development setup)
   - progress.md (current status and what's left to build)

2. Add Cline documentation links to knowledge base
3. Create Windsurf-compatible rules for Cline Memory Bank integration
4. Commit and push all Cline Memory Bank changes
5. Verify GitHub Actions pass for new changes
6. Update project documentation to reference both memory bank systems

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Dual Memory Bank Strategy

- **Decision**: Implement both KiloCode and Cline Memory Bank systems in parallel
- **Rationale**: Different AI tools have different memory bank requirements and file structures
- **Implementation**: KiloCode uses `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/`, Cline uses `memory-bank/`

### File Structure Differences

- **KiloCode**: Uses brief.md, product.md, context.md, architecture.md, tech.md
- **Cline**: Uses projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md
- **Approach**: Maintain separate but complementary systems for maximum AI tool compatibility

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Memory Bank Maintenance

- Keep both systems synchronized with project changes
- Update activeContext.md/context.md frequently during development sessions
- Maintain factual, concise documentation without speculation
- Focus on current state and immediate next steps

### Quality Standards

- All memory bank files must pass markdown linting
- Follow established project documentation patterns
- Ensure consistency between KiloCode and Cline memory bank content
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between different memory bank files

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Multi-AI Tool Support

- Different AI tools require different memory bank structures
- Parallel implementation allows teams to choose their preferred AI assistant
- Documentation consistency across systems improves overall project understanding

### Setup Automation

- Interactive CLI setup reduces configuration complexity
- Template-driven approach enables customization while maintaining standards
- Quality gates ensure generated projects meet production requirements

### Collaboration Patterns

- Human-in-the-loop workflows provide necessary oversight for AI contributions
- Clear boundaries between AI and human responsibilities improve code quality
- Metrics tracking helps teams optimize their AI collaboration effectiveness
