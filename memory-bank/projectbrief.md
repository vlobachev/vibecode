# Vibecode Blueprint Project Brief

## Project Overview

Vibecode Blueprint is a comprehensive template and framework for setting up AI-assisted collaborative development projects. The project enables "vibecoding" - natural-language driven development through agentic IDEs where developers specify intent, AI agents generate code, and validation happens via tests and execution.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals

1. **Reusable Blueprint System**: Create a template that teams can use to quickly set up collaborative AI development environments
2. **Intelligent Setup Automation**: Provide Node.js-powered setup system with Handlebars templating for generating production-ready projects
3. **Multi-AI Tool Support**: Support Windsurf, Roo Code, KiloCode, Cline, and other agentic IDEs
4. **Quality Assurance Framework**: Implement guardrails and validation processes for AI-generated code

### Key Features

- Interactive CLI setup with customizable project generation
- Human-in-the-loop workflow (AI proposes, human approves)
- Contract-driven development with clear boundaries
- Golden test protection for critical functionality
- Comprehensive documentation and onboarding materials
- Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD integration
- Memory Bank systems for multiple AI tools (KiloCode, Cline)

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- Template engine with Handlebars for dynamic project generation
- Setup scripts for automated project initialization
- Documentation framework with guides and best practices
- Quality assurance tools and validation scripts
- Memory Bank implementations for AI context preservation
- CI/CD pipeline templates and GitHub Actions workflows
- Examples and real-world usage patterns

### Out of Scope

- Specific AI model implementations
- Custom IDE development
- Direct integration with proprietary AI services
- Project-specific business logic beyond templating

## Success Criteria

1. **Setup Time**: Teams can generate a production-ready AI development environment in under 10 minutes
2. **Quality Metrics**: High percentage of AI-generated PRs accepted without post-review changes
3. **Adoption**: Framework scales from small teams to large organizations
4. **Tool Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with multiple AI coding assistants
5. **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive guides enable teams to onboard quickly and effectively
