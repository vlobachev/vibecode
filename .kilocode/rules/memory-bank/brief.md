> **Note**: For complete project overview, see **[docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../../docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)**

## Quick Summary

Vibecode Blueprint is a comprehensive template and framework for setting up AI-assisted collaborative development projects. It enables "vibecoding" - natural-language driven development through agentic IDEs.

## Core Objectives

1. Create reusable blueprint for AI development environments
2. Provide intelligent templating system (Node.js + Handlebars)
3. Establish best practices for human-AI collaboration
4. Implement quality guardrails for AI-generated code

## Key Features

- Multi-tool support (Windsurf, Roo Code, KiloCode, Cline, Claude Desktop)
- Human-in-the-loop workflow
- Automated quality checks and pre-commit validation
- Memory Bank systems for context preservation
- Comprehensive documentation

## KiloCode-Specific Context

- Memory Bank located in `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/`
- Core files: brief.md, product.md, context.md, architecture.md, tech.md, tasks.md
- Integration with KiloCode AI for context preservation
- See `memory-bank-instructions.md` for setup details
