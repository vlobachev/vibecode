# Vibecode Blueprint Project Brief

## Project Overview

Vibecode Blueprint is a comprehensive template and framework for setting up AI-assisted collaborative development projects. It transforms traditional development workflows by enabling "vibecoding" - natural-language driven development through agentic IDEs where developers specify intent, AI agents generate code, and validation happens via tests and execution.

## Core Objectives

1. **Create a reusable blueprint** that enables teams to quickly set up collaborative AI development environments
2. **Provide intelligent templating system** powered by Node.js for generating production-ready projects in minutes
3. **Establish best practices** for human-AI collaboration in software development
4. **Implement quality guardrails** to ensure AI-generated code meets production standards

## Key Requirements

- Support for multiple AI coding tools (Windsurf, Roo Code, KiloCode, and generic agentic IDEs)
- Human-in-the-loop workflow where AI proposes and humans approve
- Contract-driven development with clear boundaries and expectations
- Automated quality checks and pre-commit validation
- Comprehensive documentation and onboarding materials
- Golden test protection to prevent regression in critical functionality

## Success Criteria

- Teams can set up collaborative AI development environments in under 10 minutes
- Consistent quality metrics across AI-generated code contributions
- Reduced lead time from task to release
- High percentage of PRs accepted without post-review changes
- Scalable framework that works for small teams to large organizations
