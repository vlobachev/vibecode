# Current Project Context

## Current Work Focus

Setting up Kilocode AI Memory Bank system for the Vibecode Blueprint project. This involves creating the complete Memory Bank structure with all core files to enable better AI understanding and context preservation across sessions.

## Recent Changes

- Created `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/` directory structure
- Added `memory-bank-instructions.md` with complete Kilocode AI Memory Bank documentation
- Created `brief.md` with high-level project overview and objectives
- Created `product.md` defining problems solved and user experience goals
- Currently implementing remaining core Memory Bank files (architecture.md, tech.md)

## Active Development Areas

1. **Memory Bank Implementation**: Completing all core Memory Bank files for Kilocode AI integration
2. **Knowledge Base Enhancement**: Adding Kilocode AI documentation links to project knowledge base
3. **Documentation Standardization**: Ensuring all Memory Bank files follow Kilocode AI best practices

## Next Steps

1. Complete `architecture.md` with system design and technical decisions
2. Complete `tech.md` with technology stack and development setup details
3. Create optional `tasks.md` for repetitive workflow documentation
4. Add Kilocode AI documentation link to project knowledge base
5. Test Memory Bank functionality with Kilocode AI
6. Update project documentation to reference Memory Bank setup
