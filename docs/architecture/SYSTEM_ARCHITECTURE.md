# System Architecture Overview

**High-level architecture for collaborative vibecoding projects**

## Architecture Principles

### 1. AI-Human Collaboration

- **AI generates code** based on structured prompts
- **Humans provide oversight** through review and testing  
- **Contracts define boundaries** between AI and human responsibilities
- **Golden tests provide guardrails** for maintaining behavior

### 2. Monorepo Structure

```
packages/
├── core/              # Shared utilities, types, constants
│   ├── utils/         # Helper functions
│   ├── types/         # TypeScript definitions
│   └── constants/     # Application constants
├── api/               # Backend services and APIs
│   ├── auth/          # Authentication services
│   ├── routes/        # API endpoints
│   ├── middleware/    # Express middleware
│   └── database/      # Database access layer
├── web/               # Frontend application
│   ├── components/    # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/         # Page components
│   ├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
│   └── services/      # API client services
└── shared-types/      # Cross-package TypeScript types
    ├── api/           # API request/response types
    ├── database/      # Database schema types
    └── common/        # Shared business types
```

### 3. Contract-Driven Development

- **API Contracts**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- **Type Contracts**: Shared TypeScript interfaces
- **Test Contracts**: Golden snapshots and integration tests
- **Interface Contracts**: Clear boundaries between packages

## Data Flow

### Request Lifecycle

```
Client Request → Authentication → Validation → Business Logic → Database → Response
                     ↓              ↓             ↓            ↓         ↓
                 Middleware    Joi Schemas   Services    Repository   Serializer
```

### AI Code Generation Flow

```
Human Intent → Prompt Template → AI Generation → Human Review → Integration → Testing
      ↓              ↓                ↓             ↓            ↓          ↓
Requirements   Structured      Generated      Code Review   Git Commit   CI/CD
  Analysis        Input          Code          & Fixes       & Deploy    Pipeline
```

## Technology Stack

### Backend (API Package)

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js with middleware architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM/Prisma
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Validation**: Joi schemas for request validation
- **Testing**: Jest with supertest for integration tests

### Frontend (Web Package)

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Context for client state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with component variants
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Joi validation
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

### Shared Infrastructure

- **Build Tool**: Turborepo for monorepo management
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspace support
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier with consistent configuration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment

## AI Integration Points

### 1. Code Generation

```
Prompt Engineering → AI Model → Code Output → Human Validation
        ↓               ↓           ↓              ↓
   Templates        Windsurf/     Generated     Review Process
   & Context       Roo/Kilo       Code         & Integration
```

### 2. Quality Assurance

- **Automated Testing**: AI generates tests, humans validate coverage
- **Code Review**: AI suggests improvements, humans make decisions
- **Documentation**: AI drafts docs, humans ensure accuracy
- **Refactoring**: AI proposes changes, humans validate impact

### 3. Context Management

- **Project Memory**: Long-term context stored in AI tools (Windsurf Memories)
- **Code Patterns**: Reusable templates and examples
- **Domain Knowledge**: Business rules and requirements in structured format
- **Historical Context**: Previous decisions and architectural choices

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

```
JWT Token → Middleware Validation → Role-Based Access → Resource Permission
    ↓              ↓                      ↓                    ↓
Client Auth    Token Verification    User Roles         CRUD Operations
```

### Data Protection

- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **XSS Protection**: Output encoding and CSP headers
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: TLS encryption for all communications
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables and secure storage

### AI-Specific Security

- **Code Review Requirements**: All AI-generated code must be human-reviewed
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: AI tools cannot access production data
- **Audit Trail**: Track AI contributions and human modifications
- **Privilege Restrictions**: AI-generated commits require approval

## Performance Architecture

### Scalability Patterns

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Load balancers with stateless services
- **Database Optimization**: Indexes, query optimization, connection pooling
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for session data, application-level caching
- **CDN Integration**: Static assets served via CDN

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Application Metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Business Metrics**: User engagement, feature adoption
- **AI Metrics**: Code generation success rate, human modification ratio

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```
main (production) → develop (integration) → feature/* (development)
  ↓                    ↓                        ↓
Stable Release    Integration Testing    Active Development
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```
Code Push → Lint & Format → Type Check → Unit Tests → Integration Tests → Deploy
    ↓           ↓              ↓           ↓             ↓                ↓
 Git Hook   ESLint/Prettier   TypeScript   Jest         Supertest      Production
```

### AI Workflow Integration

```
AI Generation → Human Review → Automated Testing → Manual Testing → Deployment
      ↓              ↓               ↓                ↓               ↓
   Generated      Code Review     CI Pipeline      QA Validation    Release
     Code         & Fixes        & Guardrails      & Approval      to Users
```

## Package Dependencies

### Dependency Graph

```
web → shared-types → core
 ↓         ↓          ↓
api → shared-types → core
```

### Dependency Rules

- **No Circular Dependencies**: Packages cannot depend on each other cyclically
- **Strict Boundaries**: Internal package files cannot be imported directly
- **Version Alignment**: All packages use same versions of shared dependencies
- **Clean Interfaces**: Public APIs are explicitly defined and stable

## Future Considerations

### Scalability Improvements

- **Microservices Migration**: Break monolith into smaller services as needed
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implement message queues for decoupling
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontal database scaling strategies
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for production deployment

### AI Evolution

- **Advanced Code Generation**: More sophisticated AI models and techniques
- **Automated Testing**: AI-driven test generation and validation
- **Intelligent Refactoring**: AI-suggested architectural improvements
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI-driven insights into code quality and performance

This architecture provides a solid foundation for collaborative development while maintaining the flexibility to evolve with changing requirements and advancing AI capabilities.
